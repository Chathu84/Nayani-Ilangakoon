# Education
- Ph.D. in Geosciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA (2014-2020)
- MS in Geology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH, USA (2012-2014)
- BS in Geology, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka (2005-2009)


# Positions

**Research Scientist**, June 2023 - present: Earth Lab, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder

**Postdoctoral Research Associate**, April 2020 – May 2023: Earth Lab, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder

**Research Assistant**, 2016- 2020: Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA
- Developed and maintained full waveform lidar processing tools. Collected field data (shrub inventory and spectroscopy) and analyzed airborne full waveform lidar big data to characterize semi-arid vegetation structure (height, cover, volume), function (biomass, plant functional types), and diversity (richness, evenness, and divergence). Mentored graduate and undergraduate students in Geosciences and Computer Science.
  
**Research Assistant**, 2013- 2014: Bowling Green State University, OH, USA
- Oversaw the terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and held workshops for faculty and students about TLS handling and data collection. Integrated TLS, field observations and Landsat data to scale up mapping functional traits (leaf area index) of a forested ecosystem.
Geologist, 2011-2012: geological Survey and Mines Bureau, Sri Lanka
Conducted geological and geophysical mapping of earth resources (mineral sand, magnetite, coarse (river) sand, and Quartz. Prepared survey reports.


# Current projects
**Open Forest Observatory** – Develop Forest inventory using individual tree species and structural attributes from images collected from unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs). Test individual tree detection model transferability across site/vegetation conditions. Develop training modules to train the next generation of scientists for drone image analysis through AI and machine learning for ecological applications.  

**Ecosystem transformation and carbon consequences** - Model the postfire ecosystem transformation trends and vulnerability in the North Central CASC region and impact on carbon storage under various management scenarios using remote sensing time series analysis integrated with known locations of ecosystem transformations and management interventions.  

**Repeat fires on carbon recovery in forested systems in the western US**: Assess the impact of repeat fires (100 years of fire records) on carbon potential of forested ecoregions in the western US using GEDI, Sentinel-2, and MODIS.

**Fire Impacts on Forests** - Model post fire carbon recovery using new spaceborne lidar remote sensing (GEDI) and UAS based canopy structure and composition with climate, topography, and field observations.

**Postfire carbon potential and regeneration strategies in Southern Rockies**: Collects field inventory and UAS data across burned scars in the Southern Rockies and use structure from motion (SFM) technology and other statistical and modeling tools (R based) to map conifer seedlings and their spatial distribution and growth (carbon gain).

**Twensday-03**: Lead a collaboratory effort to develop an early warning system to identify ecosystem transformation (forest to grass, scrub and shrublands) tipping points in the western US forest systems using earth observation data cube
